## Assessment and evaluation within e-Learning Platforms
The learning outcomes of session 5 is that learners will be able to:
- Differentiate between formative and summative assessment strategies.
- Use LMS tools to monitor and evaluate learner progress effectively.
- Use EeLP assessment analytics (e.g. item difficulty, completion rates), propose one design change to the module.

Comprehensive assessment tools integrated into LMS platforms enable trainers to systematically evaluate learner performance and measure training effectiveness. Assessments are generally categorised as formative or summative, each serving distinct purposes. Formative assessments are important to provide continuous feedback that informs adaptive teaching strategies, while summative assessments offer a holistic evaluation of learner competencies upon completion of instructional activities.[^6]

<p style="margin-right: 50px;">EeLP exemplifies this functionality by incorporating advanced analytics and reporting features, which facilitate detailed tracking of learner engagement, progress, and outcomes. Trainers can thus make informed adjustments to enhance training quality and ensure the effective integration of theoretical knowledge and practical competencies.</p>
